Quotes are saved to the `library/` folder, organized by author's name. It is ignored by git.

# Usage

```

# Background
I created this repo and project to practice some ruby. I might continue working on it but I might now

# Resetting your library
[TODO] You can use the reset.rb file to start from scratch. Usually you'll want to do this after fork/cloning this repo.
